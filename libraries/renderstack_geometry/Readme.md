RenderStack Geometry
====================

RenderStack Geometry is a C++ library for manipulating geometric, polygon based 3D objects.

geometry is collection of points, polygons, corners and their attributes.

Arbitrary attributes can be associated with each point, polygon and corner.

RenderStack Geometry is designed for manipulating 3D objects, not for rendering them.
See RenderStack Mesh how to render geometry objects.
